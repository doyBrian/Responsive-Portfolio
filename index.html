      <p>I was born in Santa Cruz, California. I am the youngest of nine children.
          I am of Asian descent with Filipino, Chinese, and Japanese lineage. I currently live in San Leandro, CA, 
          in a house with four cats and three dogs! Not my own pets, but I have grown to love them
          as my own, which reinforces my love for animals. I do have my own cats, two of them -
          Leeza and Doobs!</p>

      <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering. I have worked for a little over 20
          years, mostly, in the tech industry. I worked at Intel for ten years straight out of college and recently, at Lawrence
          Livermore National Lab for three years. I quit my job in July of 2018 because I felt a void in my current field. I really 
          want to tap into my creative side thus my investment in coding bootcamp to hopefully reignite the passion that I need to
          feel inspired in a work place. And at this moment, I am loving every day of it!</p>

      <p>I enjoy performing in the theatre arts, mostly, singing, as a hobby, which taps into my creative side. 
          I love to travel, cook, drink wine, go to beach destinations, watch sunrise and/or sunset. When I am at home, I love 
          cleaning, washing dishes, doing laundry and folding clothes.</p>
