### Design Plan

1. Created `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`for separate pages.

2. Recreated basic portfolio site with the following items:

* A navbar

* A responsive layout

* eg. On `xs` and `sm` screens, content should take up the entire screen. On `md` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

* Responsive images

3. Used three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`.

* `980px` is used because you never want any of the content to be cut off. Since the desktop layout is about 960px wide, you want the media queries to kick in before your content gets cut off.

* `768px` is about the width of a tablet and `640px` is about the width of a phone in landscape.

### BONUS

* Incorporated CSS animations in the portfolio.
