      <p>I was born on June 27, 1979 in Santa Cruz, California. I am the youngest of nine children.
          I am part Filipino, Chinese, and Japanese. I currently live in San Leandro, CA. I have two
          cats named Leeza (a calico cat) and Doobs (or Ruby, a black domestic cat). In addition, I live
          in a house with four other cats and two dogs!</p>

      <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering. I have worked for a little over 20
          years, mostly, in the tech industry. I worked at Intel for ten years and recently, at Lawrence
          Livermore National Lab for three years.</p>

      <p>I enjoy performing in the theatre arts, mostly, singing, as a hobby. When I am at home, I love cleaning, washing
          dishes, doing laundry and folding clothes.</p>
